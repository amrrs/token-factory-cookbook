# Agent Cost Comparison 2

Benchmark Nebius-hosted LLMs on a small data-analysis task and compare their
**cost**, **latency**, **token usage**, and **correctness**.

Each model is run as a [deepagents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents)
filesystem agent with no shell or code-execution tool. The agent must inspect
the input files, reason over their contents, and write `result.json` and
`summary.md` to the workspace output directory.

## Task

The benchmark task is the same for every model:

1. Compare Q1 vs Q2 revenue by region.
2. Find the region with the largest absolute revenue change.
3. Calculate its signed change as Q2 minus Q1.
4. Within that region, find the product with the largest change in the same
   direction as the region's change.
5. Write `/output/result.json` and `/output/summary.md`.

The agent has to do all reasoning and arithmetic itself over the file contents —
there is no code-execution tool available.

## Output format

`result.json` must contain exactly these keys:

```json
{
  "region": "west",
  "change": -60000,
  "primary_product": "widget-b"
}
```

The values above illustrate the required types; each run must use values
calculated from its workspace files.

`summary.md` must contain the `# Sales Analysis` heading and exactly three
bullets with the actual computed values:

```markdown
# Sales Analysis

- Region with the largest revenue change: <actual region>
- Dollar amount of that change (signed): <actual signed change>
- Product that contributed most to the change: <actual product>
```

The angle-bracketed text is instructional. The agent must replace every
placeholder rather than copy it or emit label-only bullets. No Executive
Summary section is required.

## Models compared

Configured in `MODELS` in `agent_cost_comparison_1.py`:

- `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Ultra-550b-a55b`
- `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`
- `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning`

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
```

Create a `.env` file in this directory with your Nebius API key:

```bash
NEBIUS_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

The script validates the key before making any LLM calls.

## Run

Run the benchmark against the default `data-1` suite:

```bash
uv run agent_cost_comparison_1.py
```

Use a different data suite:

```bash
uv run agent_cost_comparison_1.py --data-dir data-2
```

For each model, a workspace is created at
`benchmarks/<data-suite>/<model>/` (input is copied in, output is written to
`output/`). Each result is validated against `<data-dir>/expected.json`. Once
all models finish, a comparison table is printed sorted by estimated cost.

Different data suites retain separate artifacts. Rerunning the same suite and
model replaces only that model's existing workspace for that suite.

### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--data-dir` | `data-1` | Data suite directory under this folder |
| `--dump-transcript` | off | Write messages to `<workspace>/output/_transcript.json` |

## Configuration

Key configuration values live in `agent_cost_comparison_1.py`:

| Constant | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_TIMEOUT` | `300` seconds (5 minutes) | Timeout threshold for each `agent.invoke()` call |
| `MODELS` | 3 Nebius models | Models to benchmark and their pricing |
| `OUTPUT_DATA_DIR` | `output` | Output subdirectory inside each workspace |

Adjust `AGENT_TIMEOUT` if slow runs regularly cross the threshold.

## Execution behavior

- `NEBIUS_API_KEY` is validated before any LLM calls are made.
- Each `agent.invoke()` uses an `AGENT_TIMEOUT` threshold of 300 seconds (5
  minutes). If it is exceeded, the script attempts to recover checkpointed
  messages so already-billed tokens can still be counted.
- The invocation runs in a thread, which cannot forcibly terminate an in-flight
  request. A timed-out request may therefore continue blocking until the worker
  returns before recovery proceeds.
- On an unexpected crash, the script also tries to recover checkpointed
  messages. If recovery itself fails, the original exception is preserved in
  the metrics output.
- The Nemotron-3-Ultra harness profile override is registered at runtime inside
  `main()`, so importing the module does not mutate global Deep Agents state.

## Validation

The built-in score compares `result.json` with the selected suite's
`expected.json`. It also reports whether `summary.md` exists and is nonempty.
It does not currently validate the summary heading, bullet count, or values;
inspect the generated summary or transcript when verifying a run.

## Sample output

## Files

- `agent_cost_comparison_1.py` — configuration, orchestration, and per-model
  execution (parsing, validation, cost metrics, comparison table).
- `utils.py` — workspace setup, usage/cost collection, validation, printing,
  transcript serialization, and invocation helpers.
- `data-1/input/` — source data copied into each model's workspace.
- `data-1/expected.json` — ground-truth answer used for scoring.
- `data-2/` — second input suite and its expected result.
- `benchmarks/<data-suite>/` — per-model run artifacts (gitignored).

## Debugging

Add `--dump-transcript` to preserve the complete message and tool-call history
for each model run:

```bash
uv run agent_cost_comparison_1.py --data-dir data-2 --dump-transcript
```

## Nemotron-3-Ultra compatibility

Deep Agents' built-in Ultra profile can mistake this single-turn filesystem
task for a task transition. The benchmark keeps the rest of that profile but
disables `NemotronPolicyNudgeMiddleware`:

```python
register_harness_profile(
    "nebius:nvidia/Nemotron-3-Ultra-550b-a55b",
    HarnessProfile(excluded_middleware={"NemotronPolicyNudgeMiddleware"}),
)
```
